5. Reflection (3-5 sentences)

What was the hardest part?
- In this activity, there were different factors that made it difficult to perform. One of these was the confusion regarding the venv and base libraries. This led to forgetting to activate the venv before performing the succeeding steps. There was also the issue of not remembering to go back to the project directory before doing the work. Lastly, there was an initial struggle as well when adding the columns in the output, especially when grouping the ages into bins.

What did you learn about Git commits (small commits, staging, meaningful messages)?
- Through this activity, we learned about the syntax of adding of files and committing. Additionally, the activity provided good examples of what to include in the messages. This helped ensure proper documentation of commits.
